# freeCodeCamp.org's Project based Curriculum

This repo is for the staff to add project prototypes for the new project based JavaScript and frontend libraries curriculum.

## Where can I read more about the new curriculum?

You can read all about it in [Quincy's announcement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/help-us-build-version-7-0-of-the-freecodecamp-curriculum/263546).

You can also see the new [Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) on the [freeCodeCamp learn page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).
