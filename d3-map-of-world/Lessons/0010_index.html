    D3.js, or D3, stands for Data Driven Documents. D3 is a JavaScript library
    to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser. It's
    built to work with common web standards, namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable
    Vector Graphics (SVG).

    D3:
    - Takes input data and maps them into a visual representation of the data
    - Supports many different data formats
    - Lets you bind (or attach) data to the Document Object Model (DOM)

    In this project, you'll learn the basics of D3 by building a map of the world which shows population by country.

    You'll use HTML and SVG elements with D3's built-in methods to turn geographic and population data into a visualization.

    We provided the basic HTML page structure, so to start, fill in the `title`
    of the page so it says `World Population`.
