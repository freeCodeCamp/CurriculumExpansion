Time to start filling in the `Players` array. It will hold a sequence of objects, one for each member of the 1986 Argentinian squad.

Create the first object in the array with two key-value pairs. One for `Name` with a value of `Sergio Batista`, the second for `Position` with a value of `MF` (this stands for midfielder, FYI).
