/*
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format that you use to structure data.

Because JSON is lightweight, human-readable, and easily parsed by machines, it's a popular structure to exchange data over the web.

It started as a JavaScript standard, but now it is language independent and can be used in many programming languages.

JSON is built using two structures:
1. Objects: unordered collections of key-value pairs, surrounded by `{ }`, referred to as curly braces
2. Arrays: ordered collections of values, surrounded by `[ ]`, referred to as square braces

Declare a new variable using the `const` keyword and name it `myTeam`, then set it equal to an empty object.
