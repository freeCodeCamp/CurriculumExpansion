/*
So far, you've seen value types for strings, numbers, and Boolean values. Add a new key after `World Cup Winner` for `Head Coach` and set the value as an object.

The object should have two key-value pairs in it. The first one is `Name`, set to `Carlos Bilardo`, and the second is for `Matches` (how many games he coached in the tournament), set to the number `7`.
