/*
Add two more key-value pairs to Sergio's object: `Number` set to a numeric value of `2`, and `isCaptain` set to a Boolean value of `false`.

Note the `is` part of `isCaptain`, and earlier you saw `Is` in the key name `Is World Cup Winner`. This makes the key name sound like a yes/no (or true/false) question. A common convention you'll see when a variable or key is set to a Boolean value is to start the name with `is`. This indicates to anyone reading your code or accessing that key to expect a Boolean value.
