/*
The last challenge mentioned that you structure your data in JSON with objects and arrays.

Both of those structures contain values, which can be of any of the following types:
- Strings (must use double quotes)
- Numbers
- Boolean values (`true` or `false`)
- Objects
- Arrays
- `null`

Note that JavaScript object literal syntax lets you type a key without any quotes around it. This is one place where JSON differs - make sure to put quotes around all key names.

Also, the JSON specification requires you to surround any string with double quotes (`" "`), not single quotes (`' '`).

You're going to build a structure in JSON to hold the 1986 World Cup champion team from Argentina.

Start by adding a new key into your `myTeam` object called `Team` with a string value of `Argentina`.
