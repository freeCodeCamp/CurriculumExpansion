/*
Now add two more key-value pairs to your `myTeam` object. One for `Sport` with a string value of `Football` (remember to use double quotes `"`), and the other for `Year` with a numeric value of `1986` (remember not to use any quotation marks).

Remember that key-value pairs in objects are separated by commas.
