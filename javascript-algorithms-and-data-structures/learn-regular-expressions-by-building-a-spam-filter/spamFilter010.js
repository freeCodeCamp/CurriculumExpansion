  To start with, declare a variable called `re` using `const` and set its value to `/./`.

  `/./` breaks down as follows:
  * The starting and ending forward slashes (`/`) signal that it is a regex.
  * The dot (`.`) means "match any character (other than new lines)".

  Our regex will match any string that contains a character other than a new line. For example, "A", "å—¡", and "asdf" all match, but "" doesn't.

  Note that the match can be anywhere in the string.
