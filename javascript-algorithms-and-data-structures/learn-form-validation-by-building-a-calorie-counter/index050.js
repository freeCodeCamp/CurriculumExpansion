/*
By default, `onsubmit` will pass the event object as a parameter to the function it calls.
People usually call it `e`, short for event.
Update the `calculate()` function to accept `e` as parameter.

Here is an example of an empty function called `square` that takes a `number` as a parameter
function square(number) {
}
