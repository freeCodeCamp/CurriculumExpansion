document.getElementById('calorie-form');

/*Now we need to specify what should be done with the form when the user submits it by clicking the Calculate button.

Forms have an `onsubmit` event that can execute a function when the form is submitted.

For example, in `document.getElementById('my-form').onsubmit = processForm;`, the function `processForm` will run when the form is submitted.

Assign a function named `calculate` to the `onsubmit` event of your form.

You will create the `calculate` function later. */
