A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a program.
An array is a simple data structure that can hold different types of values.
Declare a new variable using the `const` keyword and name it `products`, then set it equal to an empty array.
Here is an example of a `users` variable that equals an empty array:
```
const users = [];
```
