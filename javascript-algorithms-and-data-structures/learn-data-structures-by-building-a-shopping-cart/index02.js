const products = [];

/*
Because each product in our online pastry shop contains a lot of information, we will store it as an object which is another simple data structure.
Inside the products array, add an object with the property `name` and the value "Vanilla buttercream cupcake".
For example, here is an array that contains a similar object:
```
const users = [
  {
    name: "Phillip"
  }
];
```
