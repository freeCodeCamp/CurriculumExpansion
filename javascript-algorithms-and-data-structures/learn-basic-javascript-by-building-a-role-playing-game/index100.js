// In order to update HTML elements on the page, you need to get references to them in your JavaScript code. The code `let el = document.querySelector("#el");` gets a reference to an HTML element with an `id` of `el` and assigns it to the variable `el`. Get a reference to the HTML element with the `id` of `button1` and assign it to a variable with the name `button1`.
