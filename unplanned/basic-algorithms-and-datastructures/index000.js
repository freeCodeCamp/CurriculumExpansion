/*
Let's learn Basic Algorithms by Building an Algorithmic Newsfeed!

Line one is the empty object newsFeed. Objects have properties which can be set to values. 
Properties are made up of key : value pairs.

Observe this example of an object: var objectExample = {cats: 4}. 

The object ObjectExample has the key of cats which is set to the the numerical value of 4.

Create a property for Newsfeed with the key of 'page' and set it to the value of 'front_page'.
