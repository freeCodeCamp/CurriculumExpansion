/*
We can also add an else statement to our if block code to create additional logic.  This way we can inidicate that if one condition is true do something, otherwise, if another condition is true, do something else. 

For Example:
if (compare the condition of two values) {
  //  execute code if comparison of values is true
} else if (compare the condition of two values) {
  //  execute code if alternate comparison of values is true
}

And an else condition to our if statement which checks if a is less than b and then set result 
to equal the value of negative 1.
