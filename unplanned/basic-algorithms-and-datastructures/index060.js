Now that we are getting the hang of the structure code of our database, we have autocompleted the rest of database.

To select a specific property in an Object, we can use dot notation. Observe the following object: var learnJavascript = {Today: 'Build an algorithmic newsfeed.', Tomorrow:'Launch new company.'}

We can access the property value of Today in the object learnJavascript with dot notation as follows:
learnJavascript.Today // "Build an algorithmic newsfeed." 

Access the newsFeed object's property articles in the same manner.
