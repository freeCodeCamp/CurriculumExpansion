/*
We'll learn about RESTful APIs by building a grocery list app. It will be a backend server created with Express. RESTful APIs consist of a series of URLs that are used to create, read, update, and delete data. Each URL is called an API endpoint or request. The data sent back is called a response.

Usually the data is stored in a database, but we'll be using an array. Use `let` to create a new empty array called "list".
