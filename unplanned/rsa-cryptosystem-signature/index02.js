  There are two types of hash functions -- cryptographic and non-cryptographic. Cryptographic hash functions are used for password management and non-cryptographic ones are used for database management.
  
  The basics are same for both the types. The fixed-size value returned by a hash function is referred to as a hash value or hash.
  
  Create a variable `hashValue` and set it to 0.
