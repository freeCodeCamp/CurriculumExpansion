Cryptography is a mathematical art of protecting information from an unauthorized access.
 
Digital signature is a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of documents and messages.

First we hash our message, which is a method to transform a document into a fixed-size value.

Create an empty function `hashTheMessage()` with `message` as a parameter. 
Functions which hash the data are called hash functions.
