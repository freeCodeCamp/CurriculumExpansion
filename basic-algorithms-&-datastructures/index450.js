To check if there is any user input in our author prompt, we can make use of the .length property. The length property counts and returns the numerical value of the length of a string.

In the bracket logic of our new if conditional block code, check to see if our const searchFormula results are greater than 0. 

For Example:
var nameString = 'tom'
nameString.length // returns 3
