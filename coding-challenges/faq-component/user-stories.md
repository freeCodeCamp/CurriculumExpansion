A frequently asked questions page is a collection of commonly asked questions and answers. This will help users find answers to common queries quickly without needing to reach out to customer support for help. 

- I should see a list of frequently asked questions with answers. 

- I can click on a question to reveal the answer.

- I can click the question again to hide the answer so that the page remains clean and easy to navigate.

- The first answer should be revealed by default while the others remain hidden. 

- I should see a visual cue (e.g., an arrow or highlight) when a question is expanded so that I know which question is currently active.

- The expanding and collapsing of answers should be smooth so the experience feels natural and user-friendly.
