- I want to see a list of frequently asked questions so that I can find answers to common issues.

- I can click on a question to reveal the answer so that I can read it when needed.

- I can click the question again to hide the answer so that the page remains clean and easy to navigate.

- I want to see a visual cue (e.g., an arrow or highlight) when a question is expanded so that I know which question is currently active.

- I want the expanding and collapsing of answers to be smooth so that the experience feels natural and user-friendly.
