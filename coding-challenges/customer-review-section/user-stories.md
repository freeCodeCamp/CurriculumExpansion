1. I should see a title that says "Customer Reviews".
2. I should see a section with 5 stars in a row. Four of those stars should be filled and one star should be filled halfway(from left to right).
3. Next to the star container, I should see text that says "4.7 out of 5".
4. I should see a rating container that includes five separate breakdowns for ratings, ranging from 1 to 5 stars. Inside this container, I should see smaller sections for each rating that display the rating, percentage indicator, and the actual percentage.
