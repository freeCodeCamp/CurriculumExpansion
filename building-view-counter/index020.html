    Now let's build a view counter for this web page! This view counter will
    tell how many times this web page has been viewed. It's similar to how
    YouTube shows number of views for a video

    Let's show the view count at the end of the web page.
    Add the text "Number of times this page was viewed: " at the end of
    the <p> tag

    <h1>What's Ajax?</h1>
    <p class="article">
        AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to
        communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML
        and text files. AJAX’s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can
        communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page. <br> <br>

        The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following: <br> <br>

        1. Make requests to the server without reloading the page <br>
        2. Receive and work with data from the server <br> <br>
