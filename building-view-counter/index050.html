    <h1>What's Ajax?</h1>
    <p class="article">
        AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to
        communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML
        and text files. AJAX’s most appealing characteristic is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can
        communicate with the server, exchange data, and update the page without having to refresh the page. <br> <br>

        The two major features of AJAX allow you to do the following: <br> <br>

        1. Make requests to the server without reloading the page <br>
        2. Receive and work with data from the server <br> <br>
