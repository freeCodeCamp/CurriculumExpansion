      <h1>Main Ideas for Basics in Testing</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Typical development cycle: Code something -> Run the code -> Verify
          that the code functions as expected.
        </li>
        <li>
          For every change that you make, you have to verify every single
          function every single time.
        </li>
        <li>Manually testing code can be time consuming.</li>
        <li>
          The testing process can be automated with assert libraries and testing
          frameworks outside of your main code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assert libraries check to see if the result of your code is equal to
          the value that you expect it to be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing frameworks help you to define and run the tests that you write
          for your code.
        </li>
        <li>
          In this code sandbox, we have a Garden program in the "src" directory
          that you can write tests against. The requirements are below. Tests
          ran can be verified in the "Tests " tab.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Garden Program Requirements</h1>
      <h3>Garden</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The program can make a garden</li>
        <li>The garden can plant different kinds of plants</li>
        <li>
          The garden can only hold at most 5 fruit trees, 10 vegetable plants,
          and 7 miscellaneous plants
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Plants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plants can be given a name</li>
        <li>The plants need to be watered</li>
        <li>
          If the plants are neglected (not watered), the plants will wither
          after three days
        </li>
        <li>The plants need to be watered to recover.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fruit Trees/Vegetable Plants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fruit trees and Vegetable plants have the same requirements as plants
        </li>
        <li>
          Fruits and vegetables to fruit trees and vegetable plants respectively
        </li>
        <li>
          When you harvest fruits or vegetables, you get a count of how many
          fruits or vegetables harvested
        </li>
      </ul>
