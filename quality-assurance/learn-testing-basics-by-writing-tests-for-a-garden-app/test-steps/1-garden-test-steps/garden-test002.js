  Often, code is tested against assert libraries.
  JavaScript has its own assert functions that you can look into, but for this project, we're going to use the Chai Assertion Library.
  Require the `"chai"` module in your code and set it to variable `chai`.
  For example, here's how to require Node's File System module:
  `const fs = require("fs");`
