/*
  We will be writing tests against the code for the `Garden` program found in the starter-files directory.
  Let's write tests against the `Garden` requirements first.
  To start, import the `Garden` object from the `src` directory.
  For example, here's how you would import `Plane` from the same directory:
  `import { Plane } from "../src/Plane";`
