1. Declare a variable named `email` to store the email address you want to mask. 

2. Split the given email address by `@` using `slice()` to get the username and domain name. 

3. Store the username and domain name in `userName` and `domain` variables respectively.

4. The first letter and last letter of the username shouldn't change. Replace the remaining characters with asterisks (*) to mask it. Store the masked username in a variable named `maskedName`.

5. Combine the `maskedName` and `domain` to get the masked email address and store it in a variable named `finalMaskedEmail`.

6. Print the `finalMaskedEmail` to the console.
