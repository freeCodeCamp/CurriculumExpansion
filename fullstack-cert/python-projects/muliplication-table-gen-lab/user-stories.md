1. You should define a function named `multiplication_table` that takes two parameters:
   - `n` (an integer representing the number for which the multiplication table will be generated).
   - `limit` (an integer representing the highest multiple).
2. Inside the `multiplication_table` function, you should:
   - Print the multiplication table being generated.
   - Use a loop to iterate through numbers from `1` to `limit`.
   - Print each multiplication result in the format `n Ã— i = result`.
3. You should prompt the user to enter a number using `Enter a number: `, convert it to an integer, and call the `multiplication_table` function with the user input.
