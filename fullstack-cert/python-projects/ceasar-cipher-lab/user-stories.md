1. You should import the `string` module at the beginning of your program.
2. You should have a function named `caesar_cipher()` that takes the parameters: `text`, `shift`, and `encrypt` set to `True` by default.
3. You should define the `alphabet` variable and assign it the value of `string.ascii_lowercase`.
4. You should have an `if` statement that checks if `encrypt` is `False` and, if so, set `shift` to the negative value of `shift`.
5. You should create a `shifted_alphabet` variable that stores the alphabet shifted by the given `shift` value.
