1. You should define a function named `count_letters` that takes a `text` (a string representing the sentence to be analyzed) parameter.
2. Inside the `count_letters` function:
   - Convert the `text` to lowercase.
   - Initialize an empty dictionary named `frequencies` to store letter counts.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate through each character in the string. If the character is a letter, update its count in the dictionary.
   - After the loop, sort the letters alphabetically and print each letter with its corresponding count.
3. You should prompt the user to enter a sentence using `Enter a sentence:`, and call the `count_letters` function with the user input.
