1. You should define a function named `vowel_counter`.
1. Inside the `vowel_counter` function, you should:
    - Create a set named `vowels` that contains the vowels: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`.
    - Get a word or sentence from the user.
    - Create an empty set named `found_vowels`.
    - Iterate over each character in the user input:
        - If the character is in the `vowels` set, add it to the `found_vowels` set.
    - If the `found_vowels` set is not empty, print the unique vowels found in the user input separated by a single space using the following format: `Unique vowels found: <found_vowels>`.
    - If the `found_vowels` set is empty, print `No vowels found.`.
1. You should call the `vowel_counter` function atleast once.
