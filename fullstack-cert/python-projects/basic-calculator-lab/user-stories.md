1. You should have a `print` statement that displays the title of the program.
2. You should have a `while` loop set to `True` that keeps the program running until the user decides to exit.
3. Inside the `while` loop, you should have `print` statements that display the available operations e.g. `Addition`, `Subtraction`, `Multiplication`, `Division` and `Quit`.
4. You should have an `input` statement that prompts the user to select an operation by entering a number e.g. `1` for `Addition`, `2` for `Subtraction`, etc.
5. You should have an `if` statement that checks if the user wants to quit by entering `'q'` and breaks the loop if true.
6. You should have an `if` statement that validates if the user has entered a valid choice (1-4) and prompts them again if not.
7. You should have `input` statements that prompt the user to enter two numerical values.
8. You should have a `try-except` block to handle invalid numeric inputs and prompt the user again if they enter non-numeric values.
9. You should have functions for each operation: `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`.
10. You should call the appropriate function based on the userâ€™s selected operation and display the result.
11. Your `divide()` function should handle division by zero and return an appropriate message.
12. After displaying the result, the program should return to the beginning of the loop, allowing the user to perform another calculation or exit.
