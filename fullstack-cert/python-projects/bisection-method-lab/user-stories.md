The bisection method, also known as the binary search method, uses a binary search to find the roots of a real-valued function. It works by narrowing down an interval where the square root lies until it converges to a value within a specified tolerance.

For example, if the tolerance is `0.01`, the bisection method will keep halving the interval until the difference between the upper and lower bounds is less than or equal to `0.01`.

In this lab, you will create a function that uses the bisection method to find the square root of a number.

**User stories**

1. You should define a function named `square_root_bisection` with three parameters:

- The number for which you want to find the square root.
- The tolerance being the acceptable error margin for the result. You should set a default tolerance value.
- The maximum number of iterations to perform.

2. The `square_root_bisection` function should:

- Raise a `ValueError` with the message `Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers` if the number passed to the function is negative.
- For numbers `0` and `1`, print the message: `The square root of [number] is [number]` and return the number itself as the square root.
- For any other positive number, print the approximate square root with the message: `The square root of [square_target] is approximately [root]` and return the computed root value.
- If no value meets the tolerance condition, print a failure message: `Failed to converge within the [maximum] iterations` and return `None`.
