/*
Now that you have finished your `case_converter module`, let's publish it to the npm registry.
Normally you would need to create your own account on https://www.npmjs.com.
But for now, just use this demo account:
```
username: camper
password: camper
```
Run `npm adduser` to set your account to local.
