Now that you have finished your `case_converter` module, let's edit your README.md file.
README.md is typically a markdown file that contains a brief introduction of your npm module, and includes instructions on how to download, install, and use it.
Markdown files are just text files, but have their own basic syntax for things like headers and hyperlinks.
Write the name of your module, 'Case Converter', and use the `#` sign to make it an H1 header.
For example: `# My npm Package`
