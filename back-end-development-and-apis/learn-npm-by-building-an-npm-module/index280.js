/*
Before you can use your package, you need to import it with Node's require keyword.
For example, `const arrLenthifier = require('arr_lengthifier');` imports the `arr_lengthifier` package and assigns it to a variable.
Import your `case_converter` package with `require` and assign it to the variable `caseConverter`.
