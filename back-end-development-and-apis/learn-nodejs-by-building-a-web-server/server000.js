// To make a web server without a framework like Express, you'll need to use Node's `http` module.
// Use the `require` keyword to include a module in your code.
// For example, `const fs = require('fs')` will get the File System module and store it as the variable `fs`.
// Require the `http` module in your code and store it as the variable `http`.
