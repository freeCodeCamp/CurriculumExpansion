A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a program. 

Array is a type of data structure that can hold multiple values separated by commas.

Declare a new variable using the 'const' keyword and name it 'products', then set it equal to an empty array. 

Here is an example of a variable 'users' that equals an empty array: 

const users = [];
