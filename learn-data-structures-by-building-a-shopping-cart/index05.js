/*
We need a storage place to hold the items we buy from the store.

When we declare values inside our constructor, we attach 'this' keyword in front of them.

Create an empty array and assign it to a variable called 'items' inside the constructor. for example:

this.name = 'Phillip';

This value will then be readily accessible in other methods inside the class.
