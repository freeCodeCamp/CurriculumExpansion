/* 
It's best to set typography on the `html` and `body` elements.
First, target the `html` element and set its `font-size` to `62.5%`.
Why set it to this value? The default font-size is 16px, so here we're effectively making it 10px (62.5% * 16px = 10px).
This will make it easier for us to work with `rem` units later, as `2rem` will equal 20px, `3rem` 30px, and so on.
