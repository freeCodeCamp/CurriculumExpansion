    Before giving style or form to the piano, you must reset the
    box model to ensure an element's specified width and height
    aren't affected by padding or borders.

    Create CSS rule that targets the `<html>` element. The CSS rule should contain
    the 'box-sizing' property with the value `border-box`.

    Here's an example of a CSS that targets all `<a>` elements and removes all
    hyperlink underlines.

    ```
    a {
        text-decoration: none;
    }
