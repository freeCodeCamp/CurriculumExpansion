/* 
    Pseudo elements also need to be reset by using the `*` universal selector.
    Pseudo-elements are special keywords that follow a selector that let you
    style a specific part of the selected element.

    Add a CSS rule with the selector `*, *::before, *:after`, and set `box-sizing` 
    to `inherit`.
