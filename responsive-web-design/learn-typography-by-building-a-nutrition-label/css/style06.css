/* 
Create a CSS rule that targets the `<body>` element.
The CSS rule should contain the `font-family` property with the value "'Open Sans', sans-serif".
Here's an example of a CSS rule that targets all `<p>` elements and changes their typeface to Helvetica: 
```
p {
  font-family: Helvetica;
}
```
