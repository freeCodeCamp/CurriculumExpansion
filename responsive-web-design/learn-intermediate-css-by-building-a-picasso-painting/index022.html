            Introduction
            In this module, we will create a simplified version of "Three musicians" painting by 
            Picasso (beware there is a collage version with the same name, but we're interested in 
            the painting version, see link: https://www.pablopicasso.org/three-musicians.jsp) 
            using HTML and CSS.

            Take a good long look at the painting. You may also want to print it and keep it next
            to you will you work on this module.

            Along the way, we will learn about CSS colors (hex, RGB, webcolors...), positionning, 
            z-index, divs's shapes (squares, rectangles, circles and triangles), ids and classes, 
            and more.
            We will also use some Fontawesome icons.
            -->

            <!--
            Step 1 - In the CSS file
            Choose the 10 colors you need mixing hex colors, rgb colors and web colors

            Note: if you already know about CSS variables, you may be tempted to use them but we won't in
            this module

            2 brown colors for the background
            1 off-white color for character on the left
            2 orange & yellow colors for character in the middle
            1 false black color for character on the right
            1 blue color averlapping the 3 characters
            3 colors for brown (dark tan & light tan) and gray details

            You can check our choice of colors in the associated css file.
            -->

            <!-- Step 2 - Add the background colors -->

            <!-- Step 2-1 - In the CSS file, define your background color of the floor in the body element -->

            <!-- Step 2-2 - Create the background color of the background wall overlapping the body 
            In the HTML file, create a div with the id "back-wall" 
            In the CSS file, define the color of this div + add some styling -->

            <div id="back-wall"></div>

        </body>
