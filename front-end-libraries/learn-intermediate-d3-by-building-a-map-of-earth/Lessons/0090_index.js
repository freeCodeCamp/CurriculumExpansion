// Setup
const svgWidth = 1000;
const svgHeight = 700;

const svg = d3.select("#map")



/*
The next step your script should append an `svg` element to the `div` you have
selected in your `svg` variable. Fortunately, D3 has an `append()` method that
does just that.

D3's methods support chaining, which means you can link several together in a
row to accomplish what you're trying to do. Chain D3's `append()` method to the
end of the `select()` one, and pass it the argument `"svg"`.
