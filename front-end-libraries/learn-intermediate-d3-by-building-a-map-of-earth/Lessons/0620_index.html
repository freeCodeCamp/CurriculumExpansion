    <!--
    Believe it or not, you now have the basic map functionality done!
    Everything beyond this point will add bonus functionality and custom
    features that make your map easier to understand and use.

    You'll create a tooltip, add pan and zoom behavior, and create a legend
    for the population fill color values.

    The next set of lessons will walk you through adding the tooltip so when a
    user hovers over a country with their mouse (or taps a country on their
    mobile device), the name and population of the country are displayed. It
    will also change the formatting of the country's color and border, so it's
    obvious which one the user has selected.

    Add a `div` tag with an `id` of `tooltip`. This gives the D3 script an
    element in the HTML that it can target so the tooltip actions are visible.
