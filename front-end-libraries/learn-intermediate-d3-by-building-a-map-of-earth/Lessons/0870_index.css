/*
You may have noticed that there was a `label` class added to the `span` elements
that surrounded the "Country" and "Population" labels in the tooltip text. This
makes it easy to target and re-style.

Create a rule for the `label` class and change the text color to `#0050A1` so
it's easier to read.
