    <!--
    There are many different file formats that hold geospatial data that you can use to create maps. We're only going to focus on two that are web-friendly: GeoJSON and TopoJSON. For now, understand that they hold information that describes the shape of regions, states, provinces, and countries, among other things.

    D3 provides a script that gets the necessary information from those formats so you can create a map. A copy of this script is saved in the project folder and named `topojsonv1min.js`.

    Create another `script` tag with the `type` attribute set to `text/javascript` and the `src` attribute set to the name of the TopoJSON script file.
