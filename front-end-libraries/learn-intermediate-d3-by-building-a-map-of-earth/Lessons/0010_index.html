    In this project, you'll learn the basics of D3 by building a map of the
    world which shows population by country.

    You'll use HTML and SVG elements with D3's built-in methods to turn
    geographic and population data into a visualization.

    We provided the basic HTML page structure, so to start, fill in the `title`
    of the page so it says `World Population`.
