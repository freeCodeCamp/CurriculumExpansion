// Setup



/*
This project will use D3 to draw a map with SVG, which you'll add to your page
with this script. SVG elements have `height` and `width` attributes, so the browser
knows the size and how to display them.

Using the `const` keyword, declare an `svgWidth` variable and set it to `1000`,
and declare an `svgHeight` variable and set it to `700`.
