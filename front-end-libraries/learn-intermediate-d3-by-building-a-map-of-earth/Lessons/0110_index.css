There's one huge benefit of D3 using common web standards to create dynamic
visualizations. You can style those elements with CSS just as you would an
element you created in HTML.

Let's add a stylesheet for this project. Create a CSS rule for your `svg`
element, and add `background-color` set to `#ADD8E6`. This is a pale blue color
and it will look like the oceans in your map.
