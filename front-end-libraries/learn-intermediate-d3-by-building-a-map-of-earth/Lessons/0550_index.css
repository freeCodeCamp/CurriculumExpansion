/*
As you saw previously with the `svg` element, when D3 adds elements to the DOM,
you can target them with CSS rules just like any other element on the page.

Map styles that'll change dynamically depending on how the user interacts with the
elements will stay in the script. Static styles, such as the color of the outline
around each country, can go in the stylesheet. Note that any CSS rule in the
stylesheet will override ones added with the `.attr()` method.

For a `path` element, you color the outline with the `stroke` property. Add a CSS
rule that targets all elements with the class `countries`, and give them a `stroke`
color of white (`#fff`).
