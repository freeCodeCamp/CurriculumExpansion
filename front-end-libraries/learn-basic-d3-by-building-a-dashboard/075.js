/*
  When you added the D3 library earlier, it put an object named `d3` in your project with a bunch of functions. One of them is `select`; you can use dot notation to access this and the other functions from `d3`. Create a new `const` variable named `lineGraph` and use `d3.select` to select the `.dashboard` element. Here's an example of something similar:

  ```
  const variableName = d3.select('.className')
  ```
