1. You should use a `useState` hook and destruct the assignment to two elements returned- `bgColor`(current state value) and `setBgColor`(function that you can call to update the bgColor state).
2. The background color of the page should initally be set to white using the `useState` hook.
3. The `#pick-color-btn` button should have the `onClick` property set to the `handleButtonClick` function.
4. The `handleButtonClick` function should trigger a click event on the `#color-input` button to open the color picker.
5. The `#color-input` input should have the `onChange` property set to the `handleColorChange` function.
6. The `handleColorChange` function should set the background color of the page to the value of the `#color-input` input using the `setBgColor` function created by the `useState` hook.
