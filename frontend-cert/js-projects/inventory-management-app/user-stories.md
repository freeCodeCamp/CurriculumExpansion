1. You should declare en empty array named `inventory`, that will store product objects having a key `name` with the value of a string, and a key `quantity` with the value of an integer number.
1. You should create a function named `findProductIndex` that takes the product name as its argument and returns the index of the corresponding product object inside the `inventory` array. If the product is not found, the function should return `-1`.
1. You should create a function named `addProduct` that takes a product object as its argument. If the product is already present in the inventory, the function should update its `quantity` value and log to the console the product name followed by a space and `quantity updated`. Otherwise, the function should push the product to the `inventory` array and log to the console the product name followed by a space and `added to inventory`. 
1. You should create a function named `removeProduct` that takes the product name and quantity as its arguments. The function should subtract the passed quantity from the corresponding product object inside the inventory and log the string `Remaining <product-name> pieces: <product-quantity>` to the console, where `<product-name>` should be replaced by the product name, and `<product-quantity>` should be replaced by the product quantity. If the quantity after the subtraction is zero, the product object should be removed from the inventory. Instead, if the quantity in the inventory is not enough to perform the subtraction, the function should log the string `Not enough <product-name> available, remaining pieces: <product-quantity>` to the console.
