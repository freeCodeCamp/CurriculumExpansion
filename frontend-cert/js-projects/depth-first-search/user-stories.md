1. You should write a function `dfs()` that implements the <dfn>depth-first search</dfn> algorithm on a graph. Starting from a root node, the search first goes down a path of edges as far as it can. Once it reaches one end of a path, the search will backtrack to the last node with an un-visited edge path and continue searching down the un-visited edge path.
1. The function should keep track of the visited nodes.
1. The function should use a stack, an array where the last element added is the first to be removed, to make sure to visit the neighbors of the most recently added node.
1. The function should take an undirected, adjacency matrix `graph` and a node label `root` as parameters. The node label is the numeric value of the node between `0` and `n - 1`, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the graph.
1. The function should output an array of all nodes reachable from `root`.
