1. You should define an empty array named `results` in the global scope.
1. You should create a function named `fibonacci`.
1. The `fibonacci` function should take single parameter, which is a positive integer number.
1. A call to `fibonacci(n)` should use a dynamic programming approach to compute and return the `n`-th number from the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
1. Each computed number at the position `n` in the Fibonacci sequence should be stored at the index `n` of the `results` array.
