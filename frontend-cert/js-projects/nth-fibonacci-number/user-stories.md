1. You should define an array named `sequence` in the global scope. It should contain the number `0` and `1`.
1. You should create a function named `fibonacci`.
1. The `fibonacci` function should take a single parameter, which is a positive integer.
1. A call to `fibonacci(n)` should use a dynamic programming approach to compute and return the `n`-th number from the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
1. Each computed number at the position `n` in the Fibonacci sequence should be stored at the index `n - 1` of the `sequence` array.
