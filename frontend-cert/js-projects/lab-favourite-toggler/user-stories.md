You should have an `h1` heading that contains the a heading.

You should have an unordered list with three items.
The unordered list should have the class `item-list`.

The three list items should contain the item name followed by a `span` element with the class `favorite-icon ` and an id of `favorite-icon-1`, `favorite-icon-2`, and `favorite-icon-3` respectively.

The `span` element should contain the code `&#9825;` initially to represent an empty heart.

When the `span` element is clicked, the class `filled` should be added to the `span` with class `favorite-icon` if it doesn't exist, and removed if it does.  `&#9825;` should change to `&#10084;` to represent a filled heart.
