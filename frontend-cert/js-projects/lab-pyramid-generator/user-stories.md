1. You should have a function named `pyramid` that takes three arguments.
1. The first argument should be a string representing the pattern character to repeat in your pyramid.
1. The second argument should be an integer representing the number of rows in the pyramid.
1. The third argument should be a Boolean value.
1. The `pyramid` function should return a string in which the pattern character is repeated and arranged to form a pyramid having the vertex facing upwards when the third argument is `false`.
1. When the third argument is `true` the pyramid should have the vertex facing downwards.
1. The vertex row should have a single pattern character, and each other row should have two pattern characters more than the previous one.
