1. You should ask the user for a number using a prompt window and store the number in a variable called `inputNumber`.
   
2. Declare a variable `result` and assign it the value of 1.
   
3. Using a for loop, you should loop through all numbers from `1` to `inputNumber` (inclusive) and for each number, multiply the `result` variable by the current number.
   
4. You should log the result of the factorial of `inputNumber` to the console. The output should be in the format `The factorial of [inputNumber] is [result]`.
