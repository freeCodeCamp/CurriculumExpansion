1. Declare a variable `year` that stores the value of the year to check.

1. Use an `if/ else` statement to check if the year is a leap year.

1. To check if the year is a leap year, fulfill the following conditions in the `if` part of the statement:
- If the year is divisible by 4, then it is a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

1. If the year is a leap year, output `[year] is a leap year.` to the console. Otherwise, output `[year] is not a leap year.`. You will replace [year] with the year variable.
