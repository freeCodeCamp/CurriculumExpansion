1. You should have a `div` with the class `space`.

1. Inside the `space` `div`, there should be two more `div` elements with the class `earth` and `orbit`, respectively.

1. Inside the `orbit` `div`, there should be another `div` with the class `moon`.

1. Your `earth` and `moon` `div` elements should have a background color and `border-radius` to make them look like planets.

1. The orbit path for the moon around the Earth should be a circle. The `.orbit` `div` should be centered with respect to the `earth`

1. You should define a `@keyframes orbit` animation that rotates the `.orbit` element 360 degrees around its center. You should apply this animation to the `.orbit` element with a duration of `5` seconds, a linear timing function, and infinite iterations.
