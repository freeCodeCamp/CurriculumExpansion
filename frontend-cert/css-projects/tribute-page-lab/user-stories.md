1. Your tribute page should have a `main` element with a corresponding `id` of `main`, which contains all other elements

2. You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")

3. You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id` of `img-div`

4. Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`

5. Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`

6. You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

7. You should see an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab

8. Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

9. Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
