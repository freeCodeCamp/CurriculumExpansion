    <p class="author">By Jane Doe</p>
    <p class="text">In an extraordinary twist of fate, Grandma Edna found herself at the forefront of a potential crisis
      when her clever Wi-Fi security measures unexpectedly thwarted an alien invasion. As alien spacecraft descended
      upon the town, panic spread until Grandma Edna calmly intervened, resetting her router with a cryptic passphrase
      known only to her.</p>
    <p class="text">The aliens, encountering unforeseen technological barriers, struggled to breach Grandma Edna's
      fortified network. Frustrated and bewildered, they eventually retreated to reassess their invasion strategy,
      leaving residents both relieved and amazed at Grandma Edna's resourcefulness.</p>
