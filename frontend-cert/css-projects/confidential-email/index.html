    <p>Dear Agent <span class="blurred">S'more,</span></p>
    <p>We have an emergency. The secret formula for our <span class="blurred">Mega Marshmallow</span> has been
      compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.</p>
    <p>We suspect that <span class="blurred">Professor Puff</span> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his
      hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.</p>
    <p>Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire
      operation.</p>
