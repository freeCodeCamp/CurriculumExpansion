1. You should have a `div` with a class of `blog-post-card` to hold all your card elements.

2. You should have an image with a valid `alt` text and the class of `post-img`. You can use `cover-photo.jpg` for the `src` attribute of your image.

3. You should have a `div` with a class of `post-content`. Within the `.post-content` `div`:
    - You should have a `h2` with a class of `post-title`. Assign some text to act as the title of your blog post.
    - You should have a `p` with a class of `post-excerpt`. Assign some text to summarize the blog post (maximum of 20 words).
    - You should an have an `a` with a class of `read-more`. Assign the text `Read More` to it.

4. The `blog-post-card` class should add a white background, rounded corners, shadow for depth, overflow hidden to round the image borders, and control the card width and text alignment.

5. The `post-img` class should ensure that the image fills the card's width and adds a border at the bottom.

6. The `post-content` class should add padding inside the card for spacing.

7. The `post-title` and `post-excerpt` elements within `post-content` should be styled for text color and margin.

The `read-more` element should be styled for text color, background color, margin, `inline-block` display, `border-radius`, and `padding`. It should be styled like a button.

9. The `read-more` element should have a hover effect that changes the background color.
