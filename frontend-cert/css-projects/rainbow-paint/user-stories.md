1. Each `div` element should have `border-radius` set to `50%` except for `#cover`.

1. `#red`, `#orange`, `#yellow`, `#green`, `#blue`, `#indigo`, `#violet`, and `#white` should have the color of their `id` and the `width` and `height` properties of each of them should be `15px` less than the previous one, starting from `250px`.
