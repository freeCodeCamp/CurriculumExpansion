1. You should have a `div` element with the `id` of `container`.

1. Your `#container` should have nine `div` elements nested inside it

1. Each nested `div` element should have an `id` with the value of `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `indigo`, `violet`, `white`, and `cover`, respectively.

1. Each `div` element should have `position` set to `absolute`.

1. Each `div` element should have `border-radius` set to `50%` except for `#cover`.

1. You should target `#container` and set its `width` and `height` properties to `350px` and center the element in the viewport.

1. `#red`, `#orange`, `#yellow`, `#green`, `#blue`, `#indigo`, `#violet`, and `#white` should have the color of their `id` and the `width` and `height` properties of each of them should be `15px` less than the previous one, starting from `250px`.

1. You should use absolute positioning to center `#red` respect to its parent, and each of the remaining `div` elements (except `#cover`) respect to the previous element.

1. You should target `#cover` and set its color to `white` and its size and position to cover the bottom half of the colored `div` elements.
