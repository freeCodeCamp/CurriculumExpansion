1. You should have a `div` or `main` element that targets the class `progress-bar-container`. Inside it, there should be an `h1` heading with the text of `Car Acceleration`.


1. Inside the main div, there should be another `div` with the class `progress-bar` that contains the full width of the progress bar.

2. Your progress bar should be `800px` wide and `25px` high. 
   
3. Inside the `progress-bar` `div`, there should be another`div` with the class `percentage` that represents the actual progress of the bar. Set the appropriate display type to the `span` class to adapt it to the parent.

4. Add a background color to the progress percentage to make it visible.

5. The progress bar animation should be named `progress`. It should last for `1.5` seconds and should be slow at the beginning and fast at the end. The animation should run only once.

6. The progress should start with a width of `0` and end with a width of `75%`.

7. You should add speed labels that indicate the speed of the car at `0`, `100`, `180`, `300` mph.
