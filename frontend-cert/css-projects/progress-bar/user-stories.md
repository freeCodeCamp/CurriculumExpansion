1. You should have an `h1` heading with the text of `Car Acceleration`.


2. After the heading, there should be a `div` with the class `max-acceleration` that contains the maximum acceleration of the car.

3. Your acceleration meter should be `800px` wide and `25px` high. 
   
4. Inside the `max-acceleration` `div`, there should be another `div` with the class `acceleration-percentage` that represents the current acceleration of the car. Set the appropriate display type to this class to adapt it to the parent.

5. You should have a background color for the progress percentage to make it visible.

6. The acceleration meter animation should be named `acceleration`. It should last for `1.5` seconds and should be slow at the beginning and fast at the end. The animation should run only once.

7. The `acceleration` animation should start with a width of `0` and end with a width of `75%`.

8. You should add speed labels that indicate the speed of the car at `0`, `100`, `180`, `300` mph.
